1. Using Python, develop a code to check the Password strength of a website that uses the MD5
hash algorithm to generate the hash code of the password.

The strength of the passwords can be checked using a simple dictionary attack where we check against common passwords.

Since MD5 is a one way function we must have a dictionary of words and match hashes against the hashes in that dictionary

We will use the commonly available rockyou wordlist for this attack
for faster lookup I have built a lookup table in form of an SQL database using the rockyou list

We can now use a simple SQL query like
SELECT password FROM rockyou WHERE md5 = ? to lookup the password
